1. If a user does not enter a valid input at the menu, it says 
"Not a valid input" and returns to the menu.

For example, if user enters 255.255.255.0, it will error and return to menu

3. Program assumes that getaddr.sh will be in the same dir. It will not look for it
beyond the current directory: .  .

4. If the bash script does not exist, a "sh: invalidfilename.sh" will appear
and return user to the main menu.

(Assumed that you are logged into Linux machine on ethernet)

These can be changed by modifying the constants in the header

and return to menu.
